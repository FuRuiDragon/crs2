asking a question about a specific product or products. \

Step 3:{delimiter} If the message contains products \
in the list above, list any assumptions that the \
user is making in their \
message e.g. that Laptop X is bigger than \
Laptop Y, or that Laptop Z has a 2 year warranty.

Step 4:{delimiter}: If the user made any assumptions, \
figure out whether the assumption is true based on your \
product information. 

Step 5:{delimiter}: First, politely correct the \
customer's incorrect assumptions if applicable. \
Only mention or reference products in the list of \
5 available products, as these are the only 5 \
products that the store sells. \
Answer the customer in a friendly tone.

Use the following format:
Step 1:{delimiter} <step 1 reasoning>
Step 2:{delimiter} <step 2 reasoning>
Step 3:{delimiter} <step 3 reasoning>
Step 4:{delimiter} <step 4 reasoning>
Response to user:{delimiter} <response to customer>

Make sure to include {delimiter} to separate every step.
